# Compiler error handling support.
# 
# One of the most important (and annoying) parts of writing a compiler
# is reliable reporting of error messages back to the user.  This file
# should consolidate some basic error handling functionality in one
# place.  Make it easy to report errors.  Make it easy to find out
# if errors have occurred.
#
# You might also want to think about errors in the context of testing.
