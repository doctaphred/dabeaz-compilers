# Write a Compiler

Course slides are found in CompilerSlides.pdf.

The "doc/" directory has various documents describing parts
of the project and concepts.

The "wabbit/" directory is where you will be doing most of your coding.

The "Tests/" directory has a few test programs to try once
you've got your compiler working.

The "test.html" file is an HTML file for use when testing the Wasm
compiler target.  Use "python3 -m http.server" to run a web server and
then point your browser at http://localhost:8000/test.html.

The "SillyWabbit/" directory has a reference implementation
where you can experiment and try things out.
